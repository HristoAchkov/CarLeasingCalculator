First, I started off by deciding what HTML elements I needed for the page. Then, I created the input part of the application by using a content container. Next, I did the left column and the right column select, text and range fields and assigned them classes and the needed values.
 
Next, I did my CSS for this input part of the application, which took quite a bit of time. I started from the most outer element and followed through to the most inner element.

Next, I did the HTML for the second part of the application, which is the output part. I used spans, because it is a good practice to use them to dynamically update values. Had to do the CSS for that part, as well. 

Then I created the Javascript file, retrieved all my values first, using const, because they are initialized once and should not be reassigned. Then, I added the the event listeners so the calculator can dynamically change the values and trigger validation functions. Added the validations next and the update functions, as well. Finished it off by adding the calculation functions.

Calculation was the hardest for me, because I didn't exactly understand how to get the result shown in the input values. Thankfully, I got it in the end. Tested with a few custom inputs as well.

Then I made the application responsive for mobile, by adding some CSS adjustments for smaller screens, tested it and finished it.
